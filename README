Bio:
My name is Jason McEvoy.  Next fall, I will be a third-year student majoring in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT) in Rochester, New York. I am fascinated by computers and the latest technology, but I also have a huge passion for video games.  I grew up playing games like Super Mario 64, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Sly Cooper, which have all fueled my love for the field of game design.  Today I continue to feed this passion with games such as Mass Effect, Assassin's Creed, and Uncharted. In the future, I plan to minor or possibly dual major in Game Design and Development at RIT. It is my dream to be part of the team that develops the next great action adventure game.  I order to achieve this goal, I am learning as much as I can regarding anything computer-related.  For example, I have recently developed an interest in the fields of mobile application development and web development.  When I am not learning about new technologies, I enjoy doing many activities that are featured on IGN.  I also enjoy watching anime and sports, reading books, hanging out with friends and boating. I believe that this position at IGN would give me a great opportunity to expand my knowledge of computer technology, bolster my experience, collaborate with intelligent people and, needless to say, have lots of fun.  I think that I would make a great fit for your team and I would love to fill any position at IGN.  Thank you for your consideration.


Work Experience:

I have a lot of experience in retail and customer service, but I'm really trying to get more technical job experience.
