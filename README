Bio:
My name is Jason McEvoy.  Next fall I will be a third year student majoring in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT) in Rochester, New York. I am fascinated by computers and the latest technology, but I also have a huge passion for video games. In the future I plan to minor or possibly dual major in Game Design and Development at RIT.  I grew up playing games like Super Mario 64, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Sly Cooper. It's my dream to someday work for a company like Insomniac or Naughty Dog and be part of the team that develops the next great action adventure game.  I order to achieve this goal I am trying to learn as much as I can regarding just about anything involving computers.  Lately I've developed an interest for mobile application development and web development.  I believe that this position at IGN would give me a great opportunity to learn a lot, bolster my experience, and work with some really great people.

When I am not trying to learn new stuff I like to play video games(obviously), watch movies, watch television, watch anime, play board games, play sports, read books(not the boring ones),read comics, hang out with friends, and go boating.  I have always been a huge Batman fan.  Right now I am a Game of Thrones addict and an avid Boston Bruins fan.


Work Experience:

I have a lot of experience in retail and customer service, but I'm really trying to get more technical job experience.
