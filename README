Bio:
My name is Jason McEvoy.  Next fall I will be a third year student majoring in Computer Science at Rochester Institute of Technology(RIT) in Rochester, New York. I have a huge passion for video games and in the future I plan to also minor or possibly dual major in Game Design and Development at RIT. Someday I would like to be a part of a team to develop a great action adventure game.  I grew up playing games like Super Mario 64, Ratchet and Clank, Jak and Daxter, and Sly Cooper. Someday I would like to work for a company like Insomniac Games or Naughty Dog to develop the next great action adventure game.  Besides video games I enjoy just about every that IGN reports about.  Although I haven't ready as many comics I would like to, I do enjoy their stories.  I am an especially big fan of Batman because for me he represents the potential that every human being has if they follow their ambitions.  Batman is only human and thus has no real powers, but he always stands his ground, even in the presence god-like figures, and fights for justice.
